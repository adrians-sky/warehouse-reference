# Warehouse Reference

A 'baseball-reference'/'basketball-reference'-like fansite tracking 
Jomboy Media's [Warehouse Games](https://www.youtube.com/@warehousegames) 
statistics.


## About
Over the past year I've become a big Jomboy Media fan. I especially enjoy 
the Warehouse Games, and I thought about creating a website where I could 
track players stats. 

This would include all of the Franchise Leagues (Blitzball Battle, Floorball, 
Ball in Play), as well others like Captain's League, Challenger Series, 
1 Inning League, and 1 Inning League Roulette (my personal favourite!)

None of the content is mine. This is a "fun" project.
