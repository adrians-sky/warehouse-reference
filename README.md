# Warehouse Reference

*A 'baseball-reference'/'basketball-reference'-like fansite tracking 
Jomboy Media's [Warehouse Games](https://www.youtube.com/@warehousegames) 
statistics.

**HEAVILY WIP**. Don't expect consistent updates. This is a "fun" project I'm 
doing whenever I feel like coding outside of schoolwork.

## To Do:
- Add Player Stats
- Begin Stat Tracking

## Credits
All credits go to the [Jomboy Media](https://www.youtube.com/@JomboyMedia) 
and the [Warehouse Games](https://www.youtube.com/@warehousegames) 
Youtube Channels.

None of the content is mine. This is a "fun" project.
